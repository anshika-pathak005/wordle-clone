# Wordle ðŸŽ¯

A browser-based clone of the popular word-guessing game Wordle, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was created just for fun â€” I loved understanding the gameâ€™s logic while building it and enjoy playing it myself.

## Overview

The game selects a hidden 5-letter word, and the player has 6 attempts to guess it. After each guess, the tiles change color to give hints:

- Green if the letter is correct and in the right spot  
- Orange/Brown if the letter is correct but in the wrong spot  
- Gray if the letter is not in the word at all  

I referred to a YouTube tutorial for guidance on Wordleâ€™s logic and independently implemented the code step by step.

## Features âœ¨

- Interactive board â€” Displays guesses dynamically.  
- Color-coded hints â€” Correct, present, and absent letters are shown clearly.  
- Win/Loss detection â€” Alerts when the word is guessed correctly or attempts run out.  
- Keyboard input â€” Enter letters using the physical keyboard.  
- Clean, minimal design â€” Focus on gameplay without distractions.  

## Project Structure ðŸ“‚
